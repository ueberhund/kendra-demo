<p>To prepare for training, you can preprocess your data using a variety of AWS services, including AWS Glue, Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service, and Amazon Athena. After preprocessing, publish the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. For training, the data need to go through a series of conversions and transformations, including: + Training data serialization (handled by you) + Training data deserialization (handled by the algorithm) + Training model serialization (handled by the algorithm) + Trained model deserialization (optional, handled by you)</p>
<p>When using Amazon SageMaker in the training portion of the algorithm, make sure to upload all data at once. If more data is added to that location, a new training call would need to be made to construct a brand new model.</p>
<p>The following table lists supported <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Channel.html#SageMaker-Type-Channel-ContentType">ContentType</a> values:</p>

<p>Many Amazon SageMaker algorithms support training with data in CSV format. To use data in CSV format for training, in the input data channel specification, specify <strong>text/csv</strong> as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Channel.html#SageMaker-Type-Channel-ContentType">ContentType</a>. Amazon SageMaker requires that a CSV file doesn’t have a header record and that the target variable is in the first column. To run unsupervised learning algorithms that don’t have a target, specify the number of label columns in the content type. For example, in this case <strong>‘text/csv;label_size=0’</strong>.</p>
<p>Most Amazon SageMaker algorithms work best when you use the optimized protobuf <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/architecture/note_data_loading.html#data-format">recordIO</a> format for the training data. Using this format allows you to take advantage of <em>Pipe mode</em> when training the algorithms that support it. <em>File mode</em> loads all of your data from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the training instance volumes. In <em>Pipe mode</em>, your training job streams data directly from Amazon S3. Streaming can provide faster start times for training jobs and better throughput. With Pipe mode, you also reduce the size of the Amazon Elastic Block Store volumes for your training instances. Pipe mode needs only enough disk space to store your final model artifacts. File mode needs disk space to store both your final model artifacts and your full training dataset. See the <a href="API_AlgorithmSpecification.md">AlgorithmSpecification</a> for additional details on the training input mode. For a summary of the data formats supported by each algorithm, see the documentation for the individual algorithms or this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html">table</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
For an example that shows how to convert the commonly used numPy array into the protobuf recordIO format, see <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/factorization_machines_mnist/factorization_machines_mnist.ipynb">https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/factorization_machines_mnist/factorization_machines_mnist.ipynb</a>. .</p>
<p>In the protobuf recordIO format, Amazon SageMaker converts each observation in the dataset into a binary representation as a set of 4-byte floats and is then loads it to the protobuf values field. If you are using Python for your data preparation, we strongly recommend that you use these existing transformations. However, if you are using another language, the protobuf definition file below provides the schema that you use to convert your data into Amazon SageMaker protobuf format.</p>

<p>After creating the protocol buffer, store it in an Amazon S3 location that Amazon SageMaker can access and that can be passed as part of <code>InputDataConfig</code> in <code>create_training_job</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
For all Amazon SageMaker algorithms, the <code>ChannelName</code> in <code>InputDataConfig</code> must be set to <code>train</code>. Some algorithms also support a validation or test <code>input channels</code>. These are typically used to evaluate the model’s performance by using a hold-out dataset. Hold-out datasets are not used in the initial training but can be used to further tune the model.</p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker models are stored as model.tar.gz in the S3 bucket specified in <code>OutputDataConfig</code> <code>S3OutputPath</code> parameter of the <code>create_training_job</code> call. You can specify most of these model artifacts when creating a hosting model. You can also open and review them in your notebook instance. When <code>model.tar.gz</code> is untarred, it contains <code>model_algo-1</code>, which is a serialized Apache MXNet object. For example, you use the following to load the k-means model into memory and view it:</p>
<pre><code>import mxnet as mx
print(mx.ndarray.load(&#39;model_algo-1&#39;))</code></pre>
