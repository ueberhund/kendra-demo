<p>Monitoring is important for maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon SageMaker resources. To monitor and troubleshoot inference pipeline performance, use Amazon CloudWatch logs and error messages. For information about the monitoring tools that Amazon SageMaker provides, see <a href="monitoring-overview.md">Monitor Amazon SageMaker</a>.</p>
<p>To monitor the multi-container models in Inference Pipelines, use Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch collects raw data and processes it into readable, near real-time metrics. Amazon SageMaker training jobs and endpoints write CloudWatch metrics and logs in the <code>AWS/SageMaker</code> namespace.</p>
<p>The following tables list the metrics and dimensions for the following: + Endpoint invocations + Training jobs, batch transform jobs, and endpoint instances</p>
<p>A <em>dimension</em> is a name/value pair that uniquely identifies a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. For more information on monitoring with CloudWatch, see <a href="monitoring-cloudwatch.md">Monitor Amazon SageMaker with Amazon CloudWatch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoint Invocation Metrics</strong></p>
<p>The <code>AWS/SageMaker</code> namespace includes the following request metrics from calls to <a href="API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.md">InvokeEndpoint</a> .</p>
<p>Metrics are reported at a 1-minute intervals.</p>

<p>For an inference pipeline endpoint, CloudWatch lists per-container latency metrics in your account as <strong>Endpoint Container Metrics</strong> and <strong>Endpoint Variant Metrics</strong> in the <strong>SageMaker</strong> namespace, as follows. The <code>ContainerLatency</code> metric appears only for inferences pipelines.</p>

<p>To help you debug your training jobs, endpoints, and notebook instance lifecycle configurations, Amazon SageMaker also sends anything an algorithm container, a model container, or a notebook instance lifecycle configuration sends to <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can use this information for debugging and to analyze progress.</p>
<p>The following table lists the log groups and log streams Amazon SageMaker. sends to Amazon CloudWatch</p>
<p>A <em>log stream</em> is a sequence of log events that share the same source. Each separate source of logs into CloudWatch makes up a separate log stream. A <em>log group</em> is a group of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings.</p>
<p><strong>Logs</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipeline-logs-metrics.html">[See the AWS documentation website for more details]</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
Amazon SageMaker creates the <code>/aws/sagemaker/NotebookInstances</code> log group when you create a notebook instance with a lifecycle configuration. For more information, see <a href="notebook-lifecycle-config.md">Customize a Notebook Instance</a>.</p>
