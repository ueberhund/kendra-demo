<p>Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth sends data objects to your workers in batches. There are one or more tasks for each data object. For each task, a worker annotates one of your data objects. A batch provides the following: + It sets the number of data objects that are available to workers. After the objects are annotated another batch is sent. + It breaks the work into smaller chunks to avoid overloading your workforce. + It provides chunks of data for the iterative training of automated labeling models.</p>
<p>Ground Truth first sends a batch of 10 tasks to your workers. It uses this small batch to set up the labeling job and to make sure that the job is correctly configured.</p>
<p>After the small batch, Ground Truth sends larger batches to your workers. You can configure the batch size when you create the job using the <a href="API_CreateLabelingJob.md">CreateLabelingJob</a>. When you use the Amazon SageMaker console, your job uses 1,000 tasks in each batch.</p>
