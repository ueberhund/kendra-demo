<p>In this step you choose a workforce for labeling your dataset. You can create your own private workforce or you can use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. If you create a private workforce in this step you wonâ€™t be able to import your Amazon Cognito user pool later. For more information, see <a href="sms-workforce-management-private.md">Managing a Private Workforce</a>. Use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce for this exercise instead.</p>
<p>You can create a private workforce to test Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Use email addresses to invite the members of your workforce.</p>
<p><strong>To create a private workforce</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the <strong>Workers</strong> section, choose <strong>Private</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If this is your first time using a private workforce, in the <strong>Email addresses</strong> field, enter up to 100 email addresses. The addresses must be separated by a comma. You should include your own email address so that you are part of the workforce and can see data object labeling tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Organization name</strong> field, enter the name of your organization. This information is used to customize the email sent to invite a person to your private workforce.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Contact email</strong> field enter an email address that members of the workforce use to report problems with the task.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce to label the dataset, you are charged for labeling tasks completed on the dataset.</p>
<p><strong>To use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the <strong>Workers</strong> section, choose <strong>Public</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>The dataset does not contain PII</strong> to acknowledge that the dataset does not contain any personally identifiable information.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>The dataset does not contain adult content.</strong> to acknowledge that the sample dataset has no adult content.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and accept the statement that the dataset will be viewed by the public workforce.</p></li>
