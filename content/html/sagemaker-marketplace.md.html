<p>Amazon SageMaker integrates with AWS Marketplace, enabling developers to charge other Amazon SageMaker users for the use of their algorithms and model packages. AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that makes it easy for customers to find, buy, deploy, and manage third-party software and services that customers need to build solutions and run their businesses. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings in popular categories, such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, business intelligence, database, and DevOps. It simplifies software licensing and procurement with flexible pricing options and multiple deployment methods. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/index.html#lang/en_us">AWS Marketplace Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>An algorithm enables you to perform end-to-end machine learning. It has two logical components: training and inference. Buyers can use the training component to create training jobs in Amazon SageMaker and build a machine learning model. Amazon SageMaker saves the model artifacts generated by the algorithm during training to an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see <a href="how-it-works-training.md">Train a Model with Amazon SageMaker</a>.</p>
<p>Buyers use the inference component with the model artifacts generated during a training job to create a deployable model in their Amazon SageMaker account. They can use the deployable model for real-time inference by using Amazon SageMaker hosting services. Or, they can get inferences for an entire dataset by running batch transform jobs. For more information, see <a href="how-it-works-deployment.md">Deploy a Model in Amazon SageMaker</a>.</p>
<p>Buyers use a model package to build a deployable model in Amazon SageMaker. They can use the deployable model for real-time inference by using Amazon SageMaker hosting services. Or, they can get inferences for an entire dataset by running batch transform jobs. For more information, see <a href="how-it-works-deployment.md">Deploy a Model in Amazon SageMaker</a>. As a seller, you can build your model artifacts by training in Amazon SageMaker, or you can use your own model artifacts from a model that you trained outside of Amazon SageMaker. You can charge buyers for inference.</p>
