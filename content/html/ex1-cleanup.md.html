<p>To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, use the AWS Management Console to delete the resources that you created for this exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
If you plan to explore other exercises in this guide, you might want to keep some of these resources, such as your notebook instance, S3 bucket, and IAM role.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the Amazon SageMaker console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/</a> and delete the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>The endpoint. Deleting the endpoint also deletes the ML compute instance or instances that support it.</li>
<li>The endpoint configuration.</li>
<li>The model.</li>
<li>The notebook instance. Before deleting the notebook instance, stop it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Open the Amazon S3 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/</a> and delete the bucket that you created for storing model artifacts and the training dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the IAM console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/</a> and delete the IAM role. If you created permission policies, you can delete them, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Amazon CloudWatch console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/</a> and delete all of the log groups that have names starting with <code>/aws/sagemaker/</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
